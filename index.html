                                            Legal is known as the French Mural Capital of Canada, with more than 30 murals on display throughout the town. Often the paintings are on different walls of the same building. First-time visitors will quickly realize that these murals are not mere decorations but represent the town's history and region. These murals were painted in 1997 with the help of ACFA. Twelve artists were invited to Legal to depict the history of French immigration in the area. Moreover, Legal recognize as the French Mural Capital of the World in 2011.

                                                Legal holds a Christmas event every year. It is held at a local community center where participants can enjoy board games and food with the community members. Admission is free for those 18 and under, and tickets are $10 for those older than 18. We have not held the event until last year due to covid-19, but this year we will hold a Christmas event for the first time in two years.

                                                Legal will be a great place to go ice fishing in the winter, and Legal Lake is open for ice fishing around January. For those new to the sport, we have equipment available for rent, so please feel free to visit us at the City Center. A complete set of equipment is $50 for one day of unlimited use. We recommend bringing a warm down jacket.

                                                Every six months, Legal holds a second-hand sale. This year it will be held on November 30 at the RV Park, where residents will sell furniture and household items they no longer need. This event is very popular, and many people from outside the city of Legal attend every year. You do not have to be a local to sell, but you do need to register in advance to be allowed to sell. Please note that there will be no heaters at the venue on the day of the event, so please dress warmly.

                                                    Thanks to a measure by Alberta Parks, campers who want to spend some quiet time alone outdoors can now do so without being disturbed by an intrusive generator. Campgrounds in Alberta have become popular, and many campers are now visiting Alberta. This has caused many problems with noise and other disturbances. In response, starting June 1, Alberta will implement a pilot program to restrict the use of generators at certain campgrounds during certain hours of the day. At campgrounds, generator use will be restricted between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m.
                                                    <br>
                                                    The following campgrounds will participate in this pilot program Bow Valley and Bow River at Bow Valley State Park, Lodgepole and Ferguson Hill at Cypress Hills State Park, Gooseberry at Gooseberry State Recreation Area, Long Lake at Long Lake State Park, Micron Lake at Micron Lake State Park, Peter Lougheed State Park Elkwood, Pigeon Lake, Zeiner, and Wabaman Lake campgrounds.
                                                    <br>
                                                    According to the Province of Alberta, the goal is to minimize noise while continuing to employ generators. Campers who need extra electricity are encouraged to reserve sites with power. Exceptions are made for using generators for medical reasons, and other arrangements may be made. Since this is an entirely new program, if campers change or cancel their campsites before April 22, the state will refund the $10 change or cancellation fee. Only campsites participating in the pilot program will be refunded. Alberta hopes that the new rules will allow more campers to enjoy camping. The addition of this new rule does not affect fuel cells. Fuel cells may be used as often as desired. However, at least one campground user must be present while the fuel cell is in use. This rule is intended to prevent wildfires caused by fuel cells.
